# Random-Ball-Collecting-Game
This was a project just to learn more about pygame and i tried new stuff in this too such as:

- sprite collision
- creating boundary for sprites
- sound design
- changing program icon
This game turned out to be kind of fire not gonna lie, run it for yourself and have fun ;)
